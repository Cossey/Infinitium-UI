# Infinitium UI

Alternative UI for [Technitium DNS Server](https://github.com/TechnitiumSoftware/DnsServer).

Designed using [Framework 7](https://framework7.io/).

> This is a work in progress. There is still much to complete.

## About

Technitium DNS Server is a powerful and fully featured DNS and DHCP server that runs on .NET 5 supported platforms.

It's built in web UI is a bit lacking. Using the documented API, I have designed an alternative, mobile first user interface using the excellent Framework 7.

## Developing/Compiling

> Requires Node. You must have the `framework7-cli` package installed to build this project. 

`src` contains all the source. Change files in this folder.

Use the command `npm run build` to build. This will build all files and output them to the  `www` folder.
